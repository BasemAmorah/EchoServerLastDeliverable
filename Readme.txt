Name of github repo: EchoServerLastDeliverable
https://github.com/BasemAmorah/EchoServerLastDeliverable
User 1, Basem Amorah: Modified echo_s so that it can take an argument to indicate what IP address the log server is running at

User 2, Nathanial Cowley: Modified echo_s so that it can take an argument to indicate what port number the log server is running at

User 3, Chennasri Kaveti: Modified log_s so that it can take an argument to change its own port number 

User 4, David Mathews: Modified both echo_s and log_s so that echo_s will send a special message when it is terminating with ctrl+c with log_s not logging this message but terminate as well

User 5, Fortythree Shiaohongtu: Modified log_s so that it will log the message "echo_s is stopping" when it receives it from the server then terminate

User 6, Fortythree Shiaohongtu: Modified readme and made sure everything else worked fine.
